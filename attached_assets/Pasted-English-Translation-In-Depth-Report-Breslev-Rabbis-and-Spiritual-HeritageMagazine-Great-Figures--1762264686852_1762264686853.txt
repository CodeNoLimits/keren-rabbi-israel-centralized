Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810)

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (also spelled Nachman) is the founder of the Breslev Hasidic movement. A great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, he was born in 1772 into a family of famous Hasidic masters. From a young age, he displayed an intense spiritual quest and a thirst for authenticity in divine service. He adopted the innovative habit of speaking to God as one would to an intimate friend, using the vernacular language to express his sorrows and requests—a practice that would become the hallmark of Breslev, known as hitbodedut, or personal prayer in isolation.

In 1802, Rabbi Nachman settled in Bratslav (Breslev in Hebrew) in Ukraine, from where his teachings emanated. He attracted a circle of devoted disciples, chief among them Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov (Reb Natan), who would record his words and stories. Rabbi Nachman emphasized joy and simplicity in divine service. "Fight with all your strength to be happy at all times, for it is natural to be drawn towards sadness..." he taught. He even considered it "a great mitzvah to always be joyful".

At the same time, he recommended that everyone set aside "at least one hour each day to be alone, in a room or in the fields, and speak to God" in their own language—this is the practice of hitbodedut, often performed at night in the forests. These two pillars—fervent joy and solitary prayer—are at the heart of his spiritual approach. During his brief life (he died of tuberculosis in 1810, at only 38 years old), Rabbi Nachman composed profound teachings compiled in Likutey Moharan, as well as famous mystical tales. Refusing to name a successor, he declared before his death that "his fire would burn until the coming of the Mashiach." His disciples would continue to gather at his tomb in Uman for Rosh Hashanah, perpetuating his wish.

Even today, Rabbi Nachman remains the sole central figure of Breslev—he is both the first and last Rebbe of this dynasty, which has no direct successor. His followers study his writings and follow his living inspiration. "His unique path emphasized joy and a personal relationship with God," one article notes, and he repeated that joy is of paramount importance. His famous words—"The entire world is a very narrow bridge, the main thing is not to be afraid at all"—reflect his call for confident faith and to never despair.

Rabbi Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser (1888–1994) – "Saba"

Rabbi Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser (often called Saba Yisrael, "the grandfather") is a major figure in 20th-century Breslev. Born in Tiberias around 1888 into a family of Karlin Hasidim, the young Yisrael Odesser felt an unquenched spiritual thirst from an early age. His path changed dramatically when he "coincidentally" discovered a discarded Breslev book—Hishtap'chut HaNefesh (The Outpouring of the Soul)—and was deeply moved by its mystical teachings on personal prayer.

At that time, Breslev was looked down upon and considered a path for madmen, as its adherents often prayed alone in the woods at night, shouting to God, which shocked conventional religious norms. Despite his family's opposition (his father threw him out of the house), the young Odesser connected in 1914 with Rabbi Yisrael Halpern, better known as Rabbi Yisrael Karduner, a mysterious scholar from Safed who had moved to Tiberias. Rabbi Karduner became his mentor and transmitted the authentic spirit of Breslev to him. For five years, until 1918, Rabbi Odesser immersed himself in the teachings of this hidden master.

In 1922, Rabbi Odesser had a foundational mystical experience. Having broken a fast, he was overwhelmed with remorse and fell ill for six days. In his despair, an intense thought came to him: "Go to your room, open the bookcase, and take the first book... you will find a remedy for your soul there!". He obeyed and discovered, hidden within a book, a letter signed with Rabbi Nachman's name, containing a mystical formula: "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman". This miraculous note, which he would later call the "Petek" (the note from Heaven), filled him with indescribable joy and spiritual energy. Rabbi Odesser was convinced that Rebbe Nachman had sent him this message across the years. This sacred phrase became, for him, a remedy for all the world's suffering. Later, a certain Yoel claimed to be the human author of the letter, but Rabbi Odesser maintained the supernatural nature of the event, asserting his room was locked and he was the only key holder. Regardless, this mystical phrase "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman"—a kabbalistic mantra adding a letter of the name Nachman to each word—would become the emblem of a new Breslev stream.

For decades, Rabbi Odesser kept the Petek almost secret. He led a modest life, enduring mockery and hardship, but persevered in his exuberant devotion: in the synagogue, he would pray with such fervor that he would clap his hands, dance, and twirl for hours, filled with mystical joy. This strange behavior reinforced the religious establishment's suspicion of him. However, in the 1980s, as he approached 90 and was living in a nursing home in Ra'anana, a group of young ba'alei teshuvah (returnees to the faith) discovered him and gathered around him. Rabbi Odesser then began to widely reveal the secret of the Petek. His new disciples adopted the chant and the name "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman" as a spiritual slogan. Thus, the "Na Nach" movement was born, a subgroup of Breslev Hasidim distinguished by this motto. Initially marginalized by traditional Breslev Hasidim, the Na Nach gradually became known throughout Israel.

"Na Nach" appeared on billboards, stickers, signs, and especially on the white kippah with a tassel that these young men proudly wear. "Na Nach" inscriptions are also seen in urban graffiti and in dedicated music production. Rabbi Odesser, who had become a charismatic figure affectionately called "Saba," traveled the country to disseminate Rabbi Nachman's books—he raised funds and mass-printed Breslev teachings. In 1984, he even made the journey to Uman to pray at Rabbi Nachman's grave, a rare trip for an Israeli at the time.

Until the end of his life (he passed away in Jerusalem in October 1994, at the venerable age of 106), Saba Yisrael Odesser never ceased to encourage hitbodedut and joy. On his tombstone in the Har HaMenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem, one can read the engraving: "Rabbi Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser, who proclaimed: 'I am Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman'". This same message is considered by his followers to be a "remedy for humanity," a chant and invocation carrying deliverance. Many testify to miracles received by praying at his grave. Saba thus left a unique legacy: he revived Rabbi Nachman's flame for new generations, giving birth to a fervent movement that champions joy and pure faith.

Rabbi Yisrael Halpern "Karduner" (circa 1850–1920)

Rabbi Yisrael Halpern, nicknamed Yisrael Karduner, is a Breslev master of the fourth generation. Born around 1850 in Poland, he drew close to Breslev Hasidism after finding a Tikkun Haklali (a collection of ten psalms) in a pile of books destined for genizah (burial). Burning with spiritual aspirations, he left his family, who opposed Breslev, and went to study in Uman, Ukraine—Rabbi Nachman's city. There, he collaborated with Rav Alter of Teplik on the publication of several Breslev works, including Hishtap’hout Hanefesh (which would play a providential role in the life of his future disciple, Odesser).

Around 1908, Rabbi Yisrael Karduner emigrated to the Holy Land. He settled in Safed and then Tiberias. Of extreme austerity and piety, he led an ascetic life: it is said he subsisted only on bread and unsweetened tea, that he rose for Chatzot (midnight) prayers every single night, and that he went to pray alone in the woods every evening, barefoot, even in the dead of winter. Considered by some to be one of the 36 hidden righteous ones, Rabbi Karduner radiated a holiness that even his opponents recognized. When he prayed at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai in Meron, his ardor was such that his face shone and the ground was soaked with tears by the end of his service.

In 1914, Rabbi Karduner took the young Yisrael Dov Odesser under his wing in Tiberias, the only disciple capable of withstanding the master's intense fervor for more than a few months. Together, they studied and sang all night every Shabbat. Rabbi Karduner transmitted the deep spirit of Breslev to Odesser, especially the importance of intense prayer and joy. A famous anecdote, recounted by Saba Odesser, illustrates Rabbi Karduner's devotion: while traveling, they were blocked by torrential rain and mud and found refuge in a village. In the middle of the night, despite his exhaustion, Rabbi Karduner rose for the Chatzot prayer. He prayed with such force that the entire table began to shake, and his student, impressed, watched him in secret as the rabbi's face shone with a fearsome aura. In the early morning, the astonished villagers offered a feast to the holy man, but Rabbi Karduner took only bread and tea, refusing all earthly comforts.

Rabbi Yisrael Karduner lived the last years of his life in Tiberias. When World War I broke out, British troops unwittingly brought a cholera epidemic in 1918. Rabbi Karduner tragically lost his children one by one to the epidemic. With unwavering faith, he then announced that he would give his own life to stop the plague. Indeed, on the 9th of Heshvan 5679 (late 1918), he departed from this world—and it is reported that from that day on, the plague in Tiberias stopped completely. After his death, a tradition recounts that he would come every Friday night to make Kiddush to comfort his widow, recalling Talmudic stories of the righteous returning to bless their homes.

Rabbi Karduner is buried in the old cemetery of Tiberias, near the famous Rambam. His hilloula (anniversary of death) is celebrated every year on the 9th of Heshvan: dozens of Na Nach followers gather at his grave to dance and pray, perpetuating his joyful spirit. The letters he left are published in the collection Michtavé Yisrael by the Keren Rabbi Odesser. Although he was humble and discreet, his influence through his student Odesser was immense. "He was entirely submitted to the teachings of Rabbi Nachman," and even opponents of Breslev revered him as a holy man. Today, Rabbi Yisrael Karduner is honored as one of the hidden pillars of the Breslev tradition in the Land of Israel, the one through whom the flame was passed to the next generation.

Rabbi Moshe Breslover (Moshe Lubarski, ~1825–1890)

Rabbi Moshe Lubarski, nicknamed Reb Moishe Breslover, was one of the foremost disciples of Reb Natan of Breslev (Rabbi Nachman's scribe). Born around 1825 in Ukraine under miraculous circumstances (his parents, custodians of a ritual bath in Breslev, received a blessing for a child from Reb Natan after being childless), Moshe grew up in the shadow of Hasidic giants. After Reb Natan's passing in 1844, Reb Moshe Lubarski became a leader of the nascent Breslev community. Modest and self-effacing, he was nonetheless a prodigious scholar.

His unwavering attachment to his master Reb Natan is illustrated by a famous story: one day when Reb Moshe's house was burglarized, instead of chasing the thief, he immediately went to the study hall and opened Reb Natan's book Likutey Halakhot to the section on the laws of theft. He immersed himself in the study of those pages with fervor—shortly after, the thief, seized by remorse or by Providence, returned to give back the stolen items. Such simple faith in his master's teachings testifies to Reb Moshe's mesirat nefesh (self-sacrifice).

Settled in the small town of Tcherin in Ukraine, Reb Moshe Breslover transmitted the living tradition of Breslev to many students. Among them were Rabbi Shimshon Barski and Rabbi Yisrael Halpern (Karduner), whom he trained in the subtleties of Rabbi Nachman's teachings. He thus serves as a crucial link in the chain of transmission between the first generation of direct disciples (Reb Natan) and the subsequent generations in the Land of Israel. Reb Moshe was known for his great humility and ascetic life. It is said he studied Torah day and night, not wasting a single moment. His contemporaries recounted that he "lapped up the Torah," learning so quickly, page after page, just as Rabbi Nachman had advised.

After his death around 1890, Reb Moshe Breslover left a lasting legacy: his oral teachings and the example of his faith inspired those who would revive Breslev in the 20th century. Although no works were published directly by him, his name remains attached to Breslev hassidut—he is spoken of with reverence as the chassid par excellence, totally devoted to the memory of Reb Natan. It is partly thanks to Reb Moshe that figures like Rabbi Yisrael Karduner were, in turn, able to ignite the hearts of disciples in the Holy Land. His life illustrates the discreet yet fervent transmission of the Breslev flame through the ages.

Keren Style – Breslev (Na Nach) Culture and Lifestyle

In the modern Israeli landscape, the Na Nach movement has established itself as a true, joyful Hasidic counter-culture. While "classic" Hasidim are often associated with austere black clothing, the Na Nach stand out with their casual and colorful style. They are recognizable by their white kippah with a tassel, bearing the mystical mantra of Rabbi Nachman—Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman—and by their colorful vans that crisscross the cities.

The scene has become familiar in Israel: "First, you hear the boom-boom of electronic music in the distance. Then, a brightly painted van appears, covered in stickers, with huge speakers on the roof". From this van, young men with a bohemian look—often with long beards, sometimes long hair flowing from under their kippah—emerge, wearing tzitzit (fringes) over simple clothes. "Smiling, they begin to dance and twirl in the middle of the street to the sound of Hasidic techno". This preaching through celebration is the Na Nach hallmark: for them, serving God involves spreading joy through music and dance, sometimes very exuberantly ("blasting trance music, dancing on top of vans," as one report describes). Their van often features the ecstatic portrait of Saba Odesser with his arms raised to the sky, and it stops at key points for the crew to distribute Rabbi Nachman's books or invite passersby to dance.

Appearing in the 1980s, the Na Nach were initially seen as a marginal, even somewhat crazy, group. "It's a real Hasidic counter-culture, comparable to Hare Krishnas or Rastafarians," analyzes a sociologist, noting that they are willingly mocked by other Orthodox Jews for their lack of conventionality. It's true that many Na Nach have atypical profiles: former Tel Aviv party-goers, ex-techno musicians, young people disconnected from society, sometimes former delinquents, or simply ba'alei teshuvah in search of meaning. Their movement has no real hierarchical structure or official leader—"it's a non-institutionalized, anti-intellectual, and emotional group," which makes their numbers difficult to estimate precisely.

What binds them is a set of simple and fervent beliefs inherited from Rabbi Nachman and Saba Odesser: the search for constant happiness, the daily practice of hitbodedut (even if it means "shouting into the void" in the middle of nature, which leads some to believe they are on drugs), unwavering faith in divine mercy, and the idea that every Jewish soul can connect to God through joy. "Unlike the usual conservative image of the ultra-Orthodox, the Na Nach project a relaxed, good-natured attitude, centered on joy," notes a journalist.

The sound-equipped vans have become their main missionary tool. During summers in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, it's not uncommon to see these vehicles—often old Ford or GMC vans—cruising the beaches or lively neighborhoods, spreading catchy melodies based on remixed Hasidic chants. At each stop, it's a small street party: the Na Nach dance fervently, sometimes joined by amused onlookers. Their slogan "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman" is chanted like a mantra. This phenomenon, initially mocked, has eventually become part of the local folklore. The graffiti נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן (the Hebrew letters of the mantra) can be seen on the walls of many Israeli cities. Popular Jewish music artists have even integrated this slogan into their songs.

Despite criticism, the movement has endured. "Forty or fifty years ago, almost no one was Breslev," testifies an elder, "today it's incredible to see the change". The Na Nach have succeeded in communicating Rabbi Nachman's heritage to many young people—including non-religious ones—by making it "hype" and accessible. This cool approach to spirituality attracts people seeking authenticity without formalism. Of course, not everyone takes the Na Nach seriously: many religious people consider them whimsical, and many secular people see them as harmless troubadours, tolerated as long as they don't block traffic too much. They, on their part, are convinced of "the spiritual validity of their joyful songs, dances, and prayers, whether from a van or in the depths of a forest". They claim to faithfully follow the spirit of Rabbi Nachman, who preached joy and audacity in divine service. In this sense, the Na Nach have created an unprecedented bridge between mystical tradition and contemporary street culture in Israel.

HaEch Hype – News and Contemporary InfluenceLiving Heritage and Current Events of the Breslev Movement

Two centuries after Rabbi Nachman, the Breslev movement continues to make headlines on the international stage. Every year, the Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage to Uman, Ukraine, grows larger. Tens of thousands of faithful from around the world—mainly young Israelis—converge on Rabbi Nachman's tomb for the Jewish New Year. Despite conflicts and obstacles (the Russo-Ukrainian War complicated travel in 2022–2023), the spiritual draw remains powerful. In September 2021, for example, it was estimated that 32,000 pilgrims had traveled to Uman despite the pandemic. This enthusiasm has captured the attention of Ukrainian authorities.

In 2023, the government of Ukraine officially classified Rabbi Nachman's tomb in Uman as a "national heritage monument". This decision, made at the highest level of the Ukrainian state, grants the site enhanced legal protection and recognizes the historical and cultural importance of Rabbi Nachman. "Ukraine has designated Rabbi Nachman of Breslev's grave in Uman as a national heritage monument, affording it the highest level of protection," reported an Israeli media outlet, highlighting Ukraine's commitment to preserving Jewish heritage and strengthening ties with Israel. The Israeli ambassador to Ukraine praised this measure as "proof that Jewish culture is an integral part of Ukrainian national identity," especially at a time when cultural sites are threatened by war. This official recognition consecrates Uman's role not only as a religious pilgrimage site but also as a diplomatic and cultural bridge between Ukraine and the global Jewish community.

Meanwhile, in Israel, the Breslev movement (and particularly its Na Nach branch) has permeated popular culture. One frequently sees Na Nach stickers on cars, clips of remixed Hasidic music accumulating views on YouTube, and even influencers discussing Rabbi Nachman's teachings on joy or self-confidence. Rabbi Nachman's slogan—"אין יאוש בעולם כלל" ("There is no despair in the world at all")—is shared on social media as a motivating mantra. Online courses broadcast the Sipurei Ma'asiyot (Tales of Rabbi Nachman) to an audience far beyond religious circles. It's safe to say that Breslev is booming: where other Hasidic streams remain closed, Breslev attracts young people in search of uncomplicated spirituality, including Israeli celebrities or artists who don't hesitate to dance with the Na Nach in the streets.

Finally, Breslev's influence even extends into modern literature and psychology. Rabbi Nachman's teachings on combating sadness and the importance of expressing oneself freely before God resonate with personal development approaches. His idea that "the entire world is a very narrow bridge, and the main thing is not to be afraid" is quoted in contexts ranging from the military (to boost troop morale) to stress management therapies. The Breslev literary heritage—notably Likutey Moharan and the Tales—is the subject of new translations into French, English, etc., testifying to international interest.

In summary, the movement initiated by Rabbi Nachman of Breslev over 200 years ago is still as vibrant and relevant today. Masters like Rabbi Odesser, Rabbi Karduner, or Reb Moshe Breslover ensured the transmission of this flame through the generations, and today, Breslev enthusiasm manifests as much in contemplation at a sacred tomb in Uman as in the wild dances on the streets of Tel Aviv. This unique blend of mystical fervor and communicative joy explains the hype around Breslev: a message of hope, simplicity, and happiness that speaks to the heart of modern man. As Saba Odesser proclaimed shortly before his death: "Not everyone knows who I am... But know that my song, Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman, will bring the deliverance!"—a declaration that still resonates with the thousands of dancing Hasidim perpetuating his legacy.

תרגום לעברית (Hébreu)
דוח מעמיק – רבני ברסלב ומורשת רוחניתמגזין – דמויות גדולות בברסלב

רבי נחמן מברסלב (1772–1810)

[תמונה של פנים קברו של רבי נחמן באומן, אוקראינה.]

רבי נחמן מברסלב (נכתב גם נחמן) הוא מייסד התנועה החסידית ברסלב. הוא נינו של הבעל שם טוב, נולד בשנת 1772 למשפחה של אדמו"רים חסידיים מפורסמים. מגיל צעיר גילה חיפוש רוחני עז וצימאון לאותנטיות בעבודת השם. הוא אימץ את המנהג החדשני של דיבור אל ה' כאל חבר קרוב, תוך שימוש בשפת הדיבור, כדי להביע את צערו ובקשותיו – מנהג שיהפוך לסימן ההיכר של ברסלב, הנקרא התבודדות, תפילה אישית בהתבודדות.

בשנת 1802, רבי נחמן התיישב בברסלב (ברסלב בעברית) שבאוקראינה, משם הפיץ את תורתו. הוא משך אליו חוג תלמידים מסור, שהעיקרי שבהם, רבי נתן מנמירוב (ר' נתן), העלה על הכתב את דבריו וסיפוריו. רבי נחמן הדגיש את השמחה והפשטות בעבודת השם. "הילחם בכל כוחותיך להיות שמח תמיד, כי טבעי להימשך לעצבות..." לימד. הוא אף סבר כי "זו מצווה גדולה להיות תמיד בשמחה".

במקביל, הוא המליץ לכל אחד להקדיש "לפחות שעה ביום להתבודד, בחדר או בשדות, ולדבר אל ה'" בשפתו שלו – זוהי ההתבודדות, שלעיתים קרובות התקיימה בלילות ביערות. שני עמודי תווך אלו – השמחה הלוהטת והתפילה בבדידות – נמצאים בלב גישתו הרוחנית. במהלך חייו הקצרים (הוא נפטר משחפת בשנת 1810, בגיל 38 בלבד), חיבר רבי נחמן תורות עמוקות שקובצו בספרו ליקוטי מוהר"ן, וכן סיפורי מעשיות מיסטיים מפורסמים. הוא סירב למנות יורש, והכריז לפני מותו כי "האש שלו תוקד עד ביאת המשיח". תלמידיו המשיכו להתכנס על קברו באומן בראש השנה, ובכך הנציחו את משאלתו.

גם כיום, רבי נחמן נותר הדמות המרכזית היחידה של ברסלב – הוא בו זמנית האדמו"ר הראשון והאחרון של שושלת זו, שאין לה יורש ישיר. חסידיו לומדים את כתביו והולכים אחר השראתו החיה. "דרכו הייחודית הדגישה שמחה ויחס אישי עם ה'", מציין מאמר, והוא חזר ואמר שלשמחה חשיבות עליונה. מילותיו המפורסמות – "כל העולם כולו גשר צר מאוד, והעיקר לא לפחד כלל" – משקפות את קריאתו לאמונה בטוחה ולעולם לא להתייאש.

רבי ישראל דב בר אודסר (1888–1994) – "סבא"

[תמונה של רבי ישראל דב אודסר בשנותיו האחרונות, המכונה "סבא ישראל".]

רבי ישראל דב בר אודסר (המכונה לעתים קרובות סבא ישראל) הוא דמות מרכזית בברסלב במאה ה-20. הוא נולד בטבריה בסביבות 1888 למשפחה של חסידי קרלין, והצעיר ישראל אודסר חש צמא רוחני שלא בא על סיפוקו מגיל צעיר. דרכו השתנתה כאשר גילה "במקרה" ספר ברסלב נטוש – השתפכות הנפש – והתרגש עמוקות מתורות מיסטיות אלו על תפילה אישית.

באותה תקופה, ברסלב נתפסה בעין רעה ונחשבה לדרך של משוגעים, שכן חסידיה הרבו להתפלל לבד ביערות בלילה בצעקות אל ה', מה שזעזע את הנורמות הדתיות המקובלות. למרות התנגדות משפחתו (אביו גירש אותו מהבית), אודסר הצעיר התחבר בשנת 1914 עם רבי ישראל הלפרן, הידוע יותר בכינוי רבי ישראל קַרדוּנֶר, חוקר מסתורי מצפת שעבר להתגורר בטבריה. רבי קרדונר הפך לרבו והעביר לו את הרוח האותנטית של ברסלב. במשך חמש שנים, עד 1918, רבי אודסר ספג את תורתו של המורה הנסתר הזה.

בשנת 1922, רבי אודסר חווה חוויה מיסטית מכוננת. לאחר שהפר צום, הוא הוכה בחרטה ונפל למשכב למשך שישה ימים. בייאושו, עלתה במוחו מחשבה עזה: "לך לחדרך, פתח את ארון הספרים וקח את הספר הראשון... שם תמצא מרפא לנפשך!". הוא ציית וגילה, מוסתר בתוך ספר, מכתב חתום בשמו של רבי נחמן ובו נוסחה מיסטית: "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן". הפתק הפלאי הזה, שאותו כינה מאוחר יותר ה"פֶּתֶק" (הפתק מהשמיים), מילא אותו בשמחה ובאנרגיה רוחנית בלתי תתואר. רבי אודסר היה משוכנע שרבי נחמן שלח לו את המסר הזה מעבר לשנים. משפט קדוש זה הפך עבורו לתרופה לכל סבלות העולם. מאוחר יותר, אדם בשם יואל טען שהוא המחבר האנושי של המכתב, אך רבי אודסר עמד על האופי העל-טבעי של האירוע, והבטיח שחדרו היה נעול והוא היה היחיד שהחזיק במפתח. כך או כך, המשפט המיסטי הזה "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" – מנטרה קבלית המוסיפה אות משמו של נחמן לכל מילה – הפך לסמלו של זרם חדש בברסלב.

במשך עשרות שנים, רבי אודסר שמר את הפֶּתֶק כמעט בסוד. הוא ניהל חיים צנועים, סבל לעג וקשיים, אך התמיד במסירותו הנלהבת: בבית הכנסת, הוא היה מתפלל בהתלהבות כזו שהיה מוחא כפיים, רוקד ומסתובב במשך שעות, מלא שמחה מיסטית. התנהגות מוזרה זו חיזקה את חשדנות הממסד הדתי כלפיו. אולם בשנות ה-80, כשהתקרב לגיל 90 והתגורר בבית אבות ברעננה, גילתה אותו קבוצה של בעלי תשובה צעירים והתאספה סביבו. רבי אודסר החל אז לחשוף באופן נרחב את סוד הפֶּתֶק. תלמידיו החדשים אימצו את השירה ואת השם "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" כסיסמה רוחנית. כך נולדה תנועת "נ נח", תת-קבוצה של חסידי ברסלב המייחדת את עצמה במוטו זה. בתחילה נדחקו לשוליים על ידי חסידי ברסלב המסורתיים, אך הנ נח התפרסמו בהדרגה ברחבי ישראל.

"נ נח" הופיע על שלטי חוצות, מדבקות, שלטים, ובמיוחד על הכיפה הלבנה עם הפונפון שהצעירים הללו חובשים בגאווה. כתובות "נ נח" נראות גם בגרפיטי עירוני ובהפקות מוזיקליות ייעודיות. רבי אודסר, שהפך לדמות כריזמטית שכונתה בחיבה "סבא", סייר בארץ כדי להפיץ את ספרי רבי נחמן – הוא אסף כספים והדפיס בהמוניהם את תורת ברסלב. ב-1984 הוא אף נסע לאומן להתפלל על קברו של רבי נחמן, מסע נדיר לישראלי באותה תקופה.

עד סוף ימיו (הוא נפטר בירושלים באוקטובר 1994, בגיל המופלג של 106), סבא ישראל אודסר לא הפסיק לעודד התבודדות ושמחה. על מצבתו בבית הקברות הר המנוחות בירושלים חקוק: "רבי ישראל דב בר אודסר, שהכריז: 'אני נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן'". מסר זה נחשב בעיני חסידיו ל"תרופה לאנושות", שיר וקריאה הנושאים גאולה. רבים מעידים על ניסים שחוו לאחר שהתפללו על קברו. סבא הותיר אפוא מורשת ייחודית: הוא הצית מחדש את להבתו של רבי נחמן לדורות חדשים, והוליד זרם נלהב הדוגל בעליזות ובאמונה טהורה.

רבי ישראל הלפרן "קַרדוּנֶר" (סביבות 1850–1920)

רבי ישראל הלפרן, המכונה ישראל קַרדוּנֶר, הוא אדמו"ר ברסלב מהדור הרביעי. הוא נולד בסביבות 1850 בפולין, והתקרב לחסידות ברסלב לאחר שמצא תיקון הכללי (קובץ של עשרה מזמורי תהילים) בערמת ספרים שנועדה לגניזה. כשהוא בוער בשאיפות רוחניות, הוא עזב את משפחתו שהתנגדה לברסלב ונסע ללמוד באומן, אוקראינה – עירו של רבי נחמן. שם, הוא שיתף פעולה עם ר' אלתר מטפליק בהוצאתם לאור של כמה ספרי ברסלב, כולל השתפכות הנפש (שימלא תפקיד גורלי בחיי תלמידו לעתיד, אודסר).

בסביבות 1908, רבי ישראל קרדונר עלה לארץ הקודש. הוא התיישב בצפת ולאחר מכן בטבריה. הוא ניהל חיי סגפנות בקפדנות ופרישות קיצונית: מספרים שהוא ניזון רק מלח ותה לא ממותק, שהוא קם לתפילות חצות מדי לילה ללא יוצא מן הכלל, ושהלך להתפלל לבדו ביערות מדי ערב, יחף, אפילו בשיא החורף. היו שראו בו את אחד מל"ו הצדיקים הנסתרים, ורבי קרדונר הקרין קדושה שאפילו מתנגדיו הכירו בה. כשהתפלל על קברו של רבי שמעון בר יוחאי במירון, להטו היה כה גדול שפניו זהרו והרצפה הייתה ספוגה בדמעות בסוף תפילתו.

בשנת 1914, רבי קרדונר לקח תחת חסותו את הצעיר ישראל דב אודסר בטבריה, התלמיד היחיד שהיה מסוגל לשאת את הלהט העז של המורה ליותר מכמה חודשים. יחד, הם למדו וזימרו כל הלילה מדי שבת. רבי קרדונר העביר לאודסר את הרוח העמוקה של ברסלב, במיוחד את חשיבות התפילה העזה והשמחה. אנקדוטה מפורסמת, שסופרה על ידי סבא אודסר, ממחישה את מסירותו של רבי קרדונר: בעת שנסעו, גשם שוטף חסם אותם בבוץ, והם מצאו מקלט בכפר. באמצע הלילה, למרות התשישות, קם רבי קרדונר לתפילת חצות. הוא התפלל בכוח כה רב עד שכל השולחן החל לרעוד, ותלמידו, שהתרשם, התבונן בו בסתר בעוד פני הרב זורחים בהילה מאיימת. לפנות בוקר, הכפריים הנדהמים הציעו סעודה לאיש הקדוש, אך רבי קרדונר לקח רק לחם ותה, וסירב לכל נוחות ארצית.

רבי ישראל קרדונר חי את שנותיו האחרונות בטבריה. כשפרצה מלחמת העולם הראשונה, החיילים הבריטיים הביאו עמם בשוגג מגפת כולרה ב-1918. רבי קרדונר איבד באופן טרגי את ילדיו בזה אחר זה במגפה. באמונה בלתי מעורערת, הוא הודיע אז שהוא ימסור את נפשו כדי לעצור את המגפה. ואכן, בט' בחשוון תרע"ט (סוף 1918), הוא הסתלק מן העולם – ומסופר שמאותו יום ואילך המגפה בטבריה פסקה לחלוטין. לאחר מותו, מסורת מספרת שהוא היה מגיע מדי ליל שבת לערוך קידוש כדי לנחם את אלמנתו, מה שמזכיר סיפורים תלמודיים על צדיקים החוזרים לברך את ביתם.

רבי קרדונר קבור בבית הקברות הישן בטבריה, ליד הרמב"ם המפורסם. ההילולה שלו (יום השנה לפטירתו) נחגגת מדי שנה בט' בחשוון: עשרות חסידי נ נח מתאספים על קברו כדי לרקוד ולהתפלל, ומנציחים את רוחו השמחה. המכתבים שהותיר אחריו פורסמו בקובץ מכתבי ישראל על ידי קרן רבי אודסר. אף שהיה צנוע ודיסקרטי, השפעתו דרך תלמידו אודסר הייתה עצומה. "הוא היה כפוף לחלוטין לתורתו של רבי נחמן", ואפילו מתנגדי ברסלב העריצו אותו כאיש קדוש. כיום, רבי ישראל קרדונר זוכה לכבוד כאחד העמודים הנסתרים של מסורת ברסלב בארץ ישראל, זה שדרכו הועברה הלהבה לדור הבא.

רבי משה ברסלבר (משה לובַּרסקי, ~1825–1890)

רבי משה לובַּרסקי, המכונה ר' משה ברסלבר, היה אחד מתלמידיו הבולטים של ר' נתן מברסלב (סופרו של רבי נחמן). הוא נולד בסביבות 1825 באוקראינה בנסיבות פלאיות (הוריו, שומרי מקווה בברסלב, קיבלו ברכה לילד מר' נתן לאחר שהיו חשוכי ילדים), ומשה גדל בצילם של ענקי החסידות. לאחר פטירתו של ר' נתן ב-1844, הפך ר' משה לובַּרסקי למנהיג הקהילה הברסלבית המתהווה. צנוע ונחבא אל הכלים, הוא היה בכל זאת תלמיד חכם עצום.

דבקותו הבלתי מעורערת ברבו ר' נתן מומחשת בסיפור מפורסם: יום אחד נפרץ ביתו של ר' משה, אך במקום לרדוף אחר הגנב, הוא הלך מיד לבית המדרש ופתח את הספר ליקוטי הלכות של ר' נתן בחלק הדן בהלכות גניבה. הוא שקע בלימוד דפים אלו בהתלהבות – וזמן קצר לאחר מכן, הגנב, שנתקף חרטה או בהשגחה עליונה, חזר והשיב את החפצים הגנובים. אמונה פשוטה כזו בתורת רבו מעידה על מסירות הנפש של ר' משה.

ר' משה ברסלבר, שהתגורר בעיירה הקטנה טשערין שבאוקראינה, העביר את מסורת ברסלב החיה לתלמידים רבים. ביניהם היו רבי שמשון בַּרסקי ורבי ישראל הלפרן (קרדונר), אותם לימד את דקויות תורתו של רבי נחמן. בכך הוא מהווה חוליה מכרעת בשרשרת המסירה בין הדור הראשון של התלמידים הישירים (ר' נתן) לדורות הבאים בארץ ישראל. ר' משה נודע בענוותנותו הגדולה ובחיי הסגפנות שלו. מספרים שהוא למד תורה יומם ולילה, ולא איבד רגע אחד. בני דורו סיפרו שהוא "לָקַק את התורה" מרוב שלמד במהירות, דף אחר דף, בדיוק כפי שרבי נחמן יעץ.

לאחר מותו בסביבות 1890, הותיר ר' משה ברסלבר חותם מתמשך: תורתו שבעל פה ודוגמת אמונתו נתנו השראה לאלו שחוללו את תחיית ברסלב במאה ה-20. אף שלא פורסמו ספרים ישירות משמו, שמו נותר קשור לחסידות ברסלב – הוא מוזכר ביראת כבוד כחסיד בה"א הידיעה, שהיה מסור לחלוטין לזכרו של ר' נתן. בין היתר בזכות ר' משה הצליחו דמויות כמו רבי ישראל קרדונר להצית בתורם את לב התלמידים בארץ הקודש. חייו ממחישים את ההעברה הדיסקרטית אך הלוהטת של להבת ברסלב לאורך הדורות.

קרן סטייל – תרבות וסגנון חיים ברסלב (נ נח)

[תמונה של ואן "נ נח" ברחובות ירושלים, מקושט בתמונתו של סבא אודסר ומצויד ברמקולים להשמעת מוזיקה.]

בנוף הישראלי המודרני, תנועת נ נח ביססה את עצמה כתרבות נגד חסידית שמחה ואמיתית. בעוד שחסידים "קלאסיים" מזוהים לרוב עם לבוש שחור וקפדני, הנ נחים בולטים בסגנונם הנינוח והססגוני. ניתן לזהותם בכיפה הלבנה עם הפונפון, הנושאת את המנטרה המיסטית של רבי נחמן – נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן – ובטנדרים המקושטים שלהם המשוטטים בערים.

המחזה הפך למוכר בישראל: "קודם כל, שומעים את ה'בום בום' של המוזיקה האלקטרונית מרחוק. אחר כך מופיע ואן צבוע בצבעים עזים, מכוסה במדבקות, עם רמקולים ענקיים על הגג". מהוואן יורדים צעירים במראה בוהמייני – לעתים קרובות עם זקן ארוך, שיער ארוך המבצבץ מהכיפה – לובשים ציצית על בגדים פשוטים. "מחייכים, הם מתחילים לרקוד ולהסתובב באמצע הרחוב לצלילי טכנו-חסידי". הפצה זו באמצעות חגיגה היא סימן ההיכר של ה'נ נח': עבורם, עבודת השם כרוכה בהפצת שמחה באמצעות מוזיקה וריקודים, לעתים קרובות בצורה נלהבת מאוד ("משמיעים מוזיקת טראנס רועשת, רוקדים על גגות הוואנים", כפי שמתאר דיווח). הוואן שלהם מציג לעתים קרובות את דיוקנו האקסטטי של סבא אודסר כשידיו מורמות לשמיים, והוא עוצר בנקודות מפתח כדי שהצוות יחלק ספרי רבי נחמן או יזמין עוברי אורח לרקוד.

ה'נ נח', שהופיעו בשנות ה-80, נתפסו בתחילה כקבוצה שולית, ואפילו קצת משוגעת. "זוהי תרבות נגד חסידית אמיתית, הדומה להארה קרישנה או לראסטפארים", מנתח סוציולוג, ומציין שהם נתונים ללעג מצד אורתודוקסים אחרים בשל חוסר הקונבנציונליות שלהם. אכן, לרבים מה'נ נח' יש פרופילים לא טיפוסיים: חוגגים לשעבר מתל אביב, מוזיקאי טכנו לשעבר, צעירים במרד חברתי, לפעמים עבריינים לשעבר או פשוט בעלי תשובה המחפשים משמעות. לתנועתם אין מבנה היררכי אמיתי או מנהיג רשמי – "זוהי קבוצה לא ממוסדת, אנטי-אינטלקטואלית ורגשית", מה שמקשה על אומדן מדויק של מספרם.

מה שמלכד אותם הוא מערכת של אמונות פשוטות ונלהבות שירשו מרבי נחמן וסבא אודסר: החיפוש אחר אושר מתמיד, תרגול יומי של התבודדות (אפילו במחיר של "לצרוח אל הריק" בטבע, מה שגורם לחלק לחשוב שהם תחת השפעת סמים), אמונה בלתי מעורערת ברחמי השם, והרעיון שכל נשמה יהודית יכולה להתחבר לאלוקים דרך השמחה. "בניגוד לתדמית השמרנית הרגילה של החרדים, ה'נ נח' מקרינים גישה נינוחה וחביבה, הממוקדת בשמחה", מציין עיתונאי.

הוואנים עם מערכות ההגברה הפכו לכלי המרכזי של שליחותם. בקיץ בתל אביב או בירושלים, אין זה נדיר לראות כלי רכב אלה – לרוב טנדרים ישנים של פורד או GMC – משייטים בחופים או בשכונות הומי אדם, ומפיצים מנגינות קליטות המבוססות על שירי חסידים בגרסאות רמיקס. בכל עצירה, זוהי מסיבת רחוב קטנה: ה'נ נח' רוקדים בהתלהבות, ולפעמים מצטרפים אליהם צופים משועשעים. סיסמתם "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" מושרת כמנטרה. תופעה זו, שבתחילה זכתה ללעג, הפכה בסופו של דבר לחלק מהפולקלור המקומי. ניתן לראות את הגרפיטי נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן (האותיות העבריות של המנטרה) על קירות ערים רבות בישראל. אמני מוזיקה יהודית פופולרית אף שילבו את הסיסמה הזו בשיריהם.

למרות הביקורת, התנועה שרדה. "לפני ארבעים או חמישים שנה, כמעט אף אחד לא היה ברסלב", מעיד אחד הוותיקים, "היום זה לא ייאמן לראות את השינוי". ה'נ נח' הצליחו להעביר לצעירים רבים – כולל לא-דתיים – את מורשתו של רבי נחמן, בכך שהפכו אותה ל"מגניבה" ונגישה. גישה "קולית" זו לרוחניות מושכת אנשים המחפשים אותנטיות ללא פורמליות. כמובן, לא כולם לוקחים את ה'נ נח' ברצינות: דתיים רבים רואים בהם תמהונים, וחילונים רבים רואים בהם זמרים נודדים בלתי מזיקים, שנסבלים כל עוד הם לא חוסמים יותר מדי את התנועה. הם, מצדם, משוכנעים "בתוקף הרוחני של שיריהם, ריקודיהם ותפילותיהם השמחות, בין אם מוואן ובין אם מעומק היער". הם טוענים שהם ממשיכים בנאמנות את רוחו של רבי נחמן, שהטיף לשמחה ולתעוזה בעבודת השם. במובן זה, ה'נ נח' יצרו גשר חסר תקדים בין המסורת המיסטית לתרבות הרחוב העכשווית בישראל.

האש הַייפּ – חדשות והשפעה עכשוויתמורשת חיה ואקטואליה של תנועת ברסלב

מאתיים שנה אחרי רבי נחמן, תנועת ברסלב ממשיכה לעורר עניין בזירה הבינלאומית. מדי שנה, העלייה לרגל בראש השנה לאומן, אוקראינה, הולכת וגדלה. עשרות אלפי מאמינים מרחבי העולם – בעיקר צעירים ישראלים – נוהרים לקברו של רבי נחמן לכבוד השנה היהודית החדשה. למרות סכסוכים ומכשולים (המלחמה בין רוסיה לאוקראינה הקשתה על הנסיעות בשנים 2022–2023), המשיכה הרוחנית נותרה חזקה. בספטמבר 2021, למשל, הוערך כי 32,000 עולי רגל הגיעו לאומן למרות המגפה.

התלהבות זו משכה את תשומת לב הרשויות באוקראינה. בשנת 2023, ממשלת אוקראינה סיווגה רשמית את קברו של רבי נחמן באומן כ"אתר מורשת לאומי". החלטה זו, שהתקבלה בדרגים הגבוהים ביותר של מדינת אוקראינה, מעניקה לאתר הגנה משפטית מוגברת ומכירה בחשיבותו ההיסטורית והתרבותית של רבי נחמן. "אוקראינה הכריזה על קברו של רבי נחמן מברסלב באומן כאתר מורשת לאומי, והעניקה לו את רמת ההגנה הגבוהה ביותר", דיווח כלי תקשורת ישראלי, שהדגיש את מחויבותה של אוקראינה לשימור המורשת היהודית ולחיזוק הקשרים עם ישראל. שגריר ישראל באוקראינה שיבח את הצעד כ"הוכחה לכך שהתרבות היהודית היא חלק בלתי נפרד מהזהות הלאומית האוקראינית", במיוחד בתקופה שבה אתרי תרבות מאוימים על ידי המלחמה. הכרה רשמית זו מקבעת את תפקידה של אומן לא רק כמקום עלייה לרגל דתי, אלא גם כגשר דיפלומטי ותרבותי בין אוקראינה לקהילה היהודית העולמית.

במקביל, בישראל, תנועת ברסלב (ובמיוחד סניף 'נ נח' שלה) חדרה לתרבות הפופולרית. לעתים קרובות רואים מדבקות 'נ נח' על מכוניות, קליפים של מוזיקה חסידית ברמיקס צוברים צפיות ביוטיוב, ואפילו משפיענים המצטטים את תורתו של רבי נחמן על שמחת חיים או ביטחון עצמי. סיסמתו של רבי נחמן – "אין יאוש בעולם כלל" – משותפת ברשתות החברתיות כמנטרה מעוררת מוטיבציה. קורסים מקוונים מפיצים את סיפורי מעשיות (סיפורי רבי נחמן) לקהל הרחב הרבה מעבר למעגל הדתי. אפשר לומר שברסלב נמצאת בנסיקה: במקום שבו זרמים חסידיים אחרים נשארים סגורים, ברסלב מושכת צעירים המחפשים רוחניות נטולת עכבות, כולל מפורסמים או אמנים ישראלים שאינם מהססים לרקוד עם ה'נ נח' ברחובות.

לבסוף, השפעתה של ברסלב מתרחבת אפילו לספרות ולפסיכולוגיה המודרנית. תורתו של רבי נחמן על המאבק בעצבות וחשיבות הביטוי החופשי בפני ה' מוצאת הד בגישות של התפתחות אישית. הרעיון שלו ש"כל העולם כולו גשר צר מאוד והעיקר לא לפחד כלל" מצוטט בהקשרים הנעים מהצבא (כדי לעודד את מורל החיילים) ועד לטיפולים בניהול מתחים. המורשת הספרותית של ברסלב – במיוחד ליקוטי מוהר"ן וסיפורי מעשיות – זוכה לתרגומים חדשים לצרפתית, אנגלית וכו', המעידים על עניין בינלאומי.

לסיכום, התנועה שיזם רבי נחמן מברסלב לפני יותר מ-200 שנה עדיין חיה ורלוונטית כיום. אדמו"רים כמו רבי אודסר, רבי קרדונר או ר' משה ברסלבר הבטיחו את העברת הלהבה הזו לאורך הדורות, וכיום ההתלהבות הברסלבית באה לידי ביטוי הן בהתייחדות על קבר קדוש באומן והן בריקודים הסוערים ברחובות תל אביב. שילוב ייחודי זה של להט מיסטי ושמחה מדבקת מסביר את ההייפ סביב ברסלב: מסר של תקווה, פשטות ואושר המדבר אל ליבו של האדם המודרני. כפי שהכריז סבא אודסר זמן קצר לפני מותו: "לא כולם יודעים מי אני... אבל דעו שהשיר שלי, נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן, יביא את הגאולה!" – הצהרה שעדיין מהדהדת בקרב אלפי החסידים הרוקדים המנציחים את מורשתו.

Informe detallado – Rabinos de Breslev y legado espiritualRevista – Grandes figuras de Breslev

Rabí Najman de Breslev (1772–1810)

[Imagen del interior de la tumba de Rabí Najman en Uman, Ucrania.]

Rabí Najman de Breslev (también escrito Nachman) es el fundador del movimiento jasídico de Breslev. Bisnieto del Baal Shem Tov, nació en 1772 en el seno de una familia de famosos maestros jasídicos. Desde temprana edad, manifestó una intensa búsqueda espiritual y una sed de autenticidad en el servicio divino. Adoptó la innovadora costumbre de hablar con Dios como con un amigo íntimo, utilizando la lengua vernácula para expresar sus penas y peticiones; una práctica que se convertiría en el sello distintivo de Breslev, llamada hitbodedut, la oración personal en aislamiento.

En 1802, Rabí Najman se estableció en Bratslav (Breslev en hebreo) en Ucrania, desde donde irradió su enseñanza. Atrajo a un círculo de devotos discípulos, cuyo principal, Rabí Natán de Nemirov (Reb Natán), consignaría sus palabras e historias. Rabí Najman insistía en la alegría y la simplicidad en el servicio divino. "Lucha con todas tus fuerzas para estar feliz en todo momento, ya que es natural ser arrastrado hacia la tristeza...", enseñaba. Incluso consideraba que "es una gran mitzvá estar siempre alegre".

Paralelamente, recomendaba a cada uno reservar "al menos una hora al día para estar a solas, en una habitación o en el campo, y hablar con Dios" en su propio idioma; esta es la práctica del hitbodedut, a menudo realizada de noche en los bosques. Estos dos pilares –la alegría ferviente y la oración solitaria– están en el corazón de su enfoque espiritual. Durante su breve vida (murió de tuberculosis en 1810, con solo 38 años), Rabí Najman compuso profundas enseñanzas compiladas en Likutey Moharán, y famosos cuentos místicos. Negándose a designar un sucesor, declaró antes de morir que "su fuego arderá hasta la venida del Mashíaj". Sus discípulos continuarían reuniéndose en su tumba en Uman para Rosh Hashaná, perpetuando su deseo.

Aún hoy, Rabí Najman sigue siendo la única figura central de Breslev; es a la vez el primer y último Rebe de esta dinastía sin sucesor directo. Sus seguidores estudian sus escritos y siguen su inspiración viva. "Su camino único enfatizaba la alegría y una relación personal con Dios", señala un artículo, y repetía que la alegría es de importancia primordial. Sus famosas palabras –"El mundo entero es un puente muy estrecho, lo esencial es no tener miedo en absoluto"– reflejan su llamado a la fe confiada y a no desesperar nunca.

Rabí Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser (1888–1994) – "Saba"

[Imagen de Rabí Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser en sus últimos años, apodado "Saba Yisrael".]

Rabí Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser (a menudo llamado Saba Yisrael, "el abuelo") es una figura mayor de Breslev en el siglo XX. Nacido en Tiberíades alrededor de 1888 en el seno de una familia de jasidim de Karlin, el joven Yisrael Odesser sintió muy pronto una sed espiritual insatisfecha. Su camino dio un vuelco cuando descubrió por "casualidad" un libro de Breslev abandonado –Hishtap'jut Hanefesh (El Derramamiento del Alma)– y quedó profundamente conmovido por estas enseñanzas místicas sobre la oración personal.

En esa época, Breslev era mal visto y considerado un camino de locos, ya que sus adeptos a menudo rezaban solos en los bosques por la noche gritando a Dios, lo que chocaba con las normas religiosas convencionales. A pesar de la oposición de su familia (su padre lo echó de casa), el joven Odesser se conectó en 1914 con Rabí Yisrael Halpern, más conocido como Rabí Yisrael Karduner, un misterioso erudito de Safed que se había mudado a Tiberíades. Rabí Karduner se convirtió en su mentor y le transmitió el espíritu auténtico de Breslev. Durante cinco años, hasta 1918, Rabí Odesser se impregnó de la enseñanza de este maestro oculto.

En 1922, Rabí Odesser vivió una experiencia mística fundacional. Habiendo roto un ayuno, se sintió abrumado por el remordimiento y cayó enfermo durante seis días. En su desesperación, le vino un pensamiento intenso: "¡Ve a tu habitación, abre la biblioteca y toma el primer libro... allí encontrarás un remedio para tu alma!". Obedeció y descubrió, escondida dentro de un libro, una carta firmada con el nombre de Rabí Najman con una fórmula mística: "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman". Esta nota milagrosa, que más tarde llamaría el "Petek" (la nota del Cielo), lo llenó de una alegría y una energía espiritual indescriptibles. Rabí Odesser estaba convencido de que Rebe Najman le había enviado este mensaje a través de los años. Esta frase sagrada se convirtió para él en un remedio para todos los sufrimientos del mundo. Más tarde, un tal Yoel afirmaría ser el autor humano de la carta, pero Rabí Odesser se mantuvo firme en el carácter sobrenatural de este evento, asegurando que su habitación estaba cerrada con llave y que él era el único que la tenía. Sea como fuere, esta frase mística "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman" –un verdadero mantra cabalístico que añade una letra del nombre Najman a cada palabra– se convertiría en el emblema de una nueva corriente de Breslev.

Durante décadas, Rabí Odesser mantuvo el Petek casi en secreto. Llevó una vida modesta, sufriendo burlas y pruebas, pero perseveró en su devoción exuberante: en la sinagoga, rezaba con tal fervor que se ponía a dar palmas, bailar y girar durante horas, lleno de alegría mística. Este comportamiento extraño reforzó la desconfianza del establishment religioso hacia él. Sin embargo, en los años 80, cuando se acercaba a los 90 años y vivía en una residencia de ancianos en Ra'anana, un grupo de jóvenes ba'alei teshuvá (retornados a la fe) lo descubrió y se reunió a su alrededor. Rabí Odesser comenzó entonces a revelar ampliamente el secreto del Petek. Sus nuevos discípulos adoptaron el canto y el nombre "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman" como un eslogan espiritual. Así nació el movimiento "Na Nach", un subgrupo de los jasidim de Breslev que se singulariza por este lema. Inicialmente marginados por los Breslev tradicionales, los Na Nach se dieron a conocer poco a poco en todo Israel.

"Na Nach" apareció en vallas publicitarias, pegatinas, pancartas y, sobre todo, en la kipá blanca con borla que estos jóvenes llevan con orgullo. También se ven inscripciones "Na Nach" en grafitis urbanos y una producción musical dedicada. Rabí Odesser, convertido en una figura carismática llamada afectuosamente "Saba", recorrió el país para difundir los libros de Rabí Najman: recaudó fondos e imprimió en masa las enseñanzas de Breslev. En 1984, incluso realizó el viaje a Uman para rezar en la tumba de Rabí Najman, un periplo entonces raro para un israelí.

Hasta el final de su vida (falleció en Jerusalén en octubre de 1994, a la venerable edad de 106 años), Saba Yisrael Odesser no dejó de fomentar la hitbodedut y la alegría. En su lápida en el cementerio de Har HaMenujot en Jerusalén, se puede leer grabado: "Rabí Yisrael Dov Ber Odesser, quien proclamó: 'Yo soy Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman'". Este mismo mensaje es considerado por sus adeptos como un "remedio para la humanidad", un canto y una invocación portadores de liberación. Muchos atestiguan milagros obtenidos al rezar en su tumba. Saba dejó así un legado singular: reavivó la llama de Rabí Najman para las nuevas generaciones, dando a luz a una corriente ferviente que aboga por el júbilo y la fe pura.

Rabí Yisrael Halpern "Karduner" (hacia 1850–1920)

Rabí Yisrael Halpern, apodado Yisrael Karduner, es un maestro de Breslev de la cuarta generación. Nacido hacia 1850 en Polonia, se acercó al jasidismo de Breslev tras encontrar un Tikkun Haklali (colección de diez salmos) en un montón de libros destinados a la guenizá. Ardiendo en aspiraciones espirituales, dejó a su familia, que se oponía a Breslev, y partió a estudiar a Uman, Ucrania, la ciudad de Rabí Najman. Allí, colaboró con el Rav Alter de Teplik en la publicación de varias obras de Breslev, entre ellas Hishtap'jut Hanefesh (que jugaría un papel providencial en la vida de su futuro discípulo Odesser).

Hacia 1908, Rabí Yisrael Karduner emigró a Tierra Santa. Se estableció en Safed y luego en Tiberíades. De una austeridad y piedad extremas, llevaba una vida ascética: se cuenta que solo se alimentaba de pan y té sin azúcar, que se levantaba para las oraciones de Jatzot (medianoche) todas las noches sin excepción, y que se
